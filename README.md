#Simple Resume

##About

This is a simple resume that I built after our introduction to HTML and CSS class at the CodeCore web development bootcamp. I used Bootstrap to improve the layout and look of the site and icon fonts (entypo) for the fun icons.
===============================
##Future Improvements

The site looks nice and it is responsive(thanks to the magic of Bootstrap), but it is pretty slow for such a simple site. I'd definitely need to do some website optimization fixes, perhaps loading the icon font differently and compressing and inlining the CSS and compressing the images.The site also does not do much, perhaps it could have a nice nav bar at the top and a section with links to other project pages.
